## Instructions

Work with a partner to edit a project and manage your changes with git.

## Steps

1. Find a partner. Pick one person to copy the app folder so that it is outside of this repo. Initialize it as its own git repo and link it to a remote on Github.
2. Decide on your git workflow and record it inside the repo before you start. Be sure to commit it before moving on to the tasks.
3. Taking turns, go to [this app](https://random-task-generator.firebaseapp.com) and generate a task. Do the task and make your changes available to your partner on Github.
4. Once you've completed one task, slack your partner to start theirs. Do this 5 times.
5. When you complete the process with working code, you should both submit the link to the repo.
